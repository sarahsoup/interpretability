t: hello andrea
c: hi
t: welcome
c: hi yeah it’s I’m here um yeah I uh yeah I’m here
t: I’m glad to see you
c: yeah it’s I think it’s good to see you too
t: so we can decide together how to do this um do you wanna tell me a little bit about why you’re coming in today
c: yeah so [nvv] I um it was my 21st birthday a little bit ago and I drank way too much and was hospitalized and then a couple weeks ago um I was drinking and coming home from the bar and I decided it was OK to drive um but I got pulled over and I’m gonna get a DUI
t: so you’re in the middle of a a legal process with that
c: yeah yeah
t: and kind of do you know where you are with all that stuff
c: um it’s really just preliminary I’m trying to see what I can do through the university um so I don’t lose um being able to go to class or anything { mm hm } um but I’m really at the beginning stages of it
t: ok and so you { [nvv] } came here to { [nvv] } talk about that type of thing
c: yeah I think I really I think my drinking has kind of gone too far and I really could have hurt someone driving um and I think I I think I need some help
t: yeah so you’re here to get some help
c: yeah so I I didn’t think my drinking was a problem and I thought you know it was my 21st birthday and people always drink too much on their 21st birthday so I didn’t think like I had a problem going to the hospital I just thought that I drank too much but um getting (getting) a DUI I really think I’m I think I’m drinking too much
t: so (there’s) there’s a lot going on there’s some complex feelings about { [nvv] } kind of what { [nvv] } happened and your relationship to yourself in the process
c: yeah
t: how are you feeling
c: [nvv] um pretty anxious scared um really really nervous { mm hm } I think I’m nervous for myself um for my health and for I mean obviously for other people cause I { yeah } just like you can’t drive when you’re drunk { [du] } I can’t I can’t believe that I did
t: yeah you say you’re nervous for your health
c: yeah yeah so I I drank at home I started drinking at home when I was little just like you know my parents would have wine with dinner and my dad drinks a lot but it was I mean I don’t think he has a problem drinking I just think he enjoys drinking with meals so I started drinking at home and then when I got to college I started drinking more and more and I think it’s it’s really gone up to where I I drink about a fifth a week
t: ok { and that’s | so I } been an increase from {kind of a steady | yeah that’s been an increase } increase from when you began drinking as a child even
c: yeah yeah {uh huh} and especially when I started college um and I’m just I want to be healthy and I want to take care of my body but I really drinking has definitely had an impact on me
t: it’s had an impact on you
c: yeah on my health that you know being hung over and not remembering some bits of nights like I I don’t think I’m like a big partier I mean my friends my friends will go out and so I’ll go out with them and so (I’ll) I’ll drink when I go out with them I don’t wanna I feel weird going out with them and not drinking um so I just
t: so you feel some pressure to participate in { drinking | yeah } when you’re out with them
c: yeah I do um
t: that’s { but } pretty normal
c: yeah yeah but (I don’t i*) I don’t feel that there’s like it has to be this like aggressive night of drinking that it always it seems to turn into me not really remembering details of the night or just drinking too much and being hung over the next day and
t: so you have some memory stuff going on { yeah } is it like a { blackout | yeah } type of scenario
c: yeah { yeah } lots of details are just gone
t:  yeah { [nvv] } yeah and then being hung over the next day { mm hm yeah } talk about that a little bit
c: um I don’t know just I haven’t I haven’t missed class and I don’t miss any assignments my grades are still good so I really don’t think it’s affecting my school work { mm hm } but I’ll wake up on Saturday morning and I’ll just feel so shitty like I’ll just feel awful and I can’t really do anything for the day and I’ll I mean I’ll shower but just kind of hang out in bed all day and { mm hm } [nvv] just do homework I don’t really I don’t really do anything on Saturdays and Sundays (bec*) if I drank the night before because { yeah } I’m hung over and I
t: so you’ve managed to keep some of your grades you’ve managed to keep your grades up { yeah yeah | but } { it’s not affecting my } yeah but some other stuff is kind of suffering as a result maybe { yeah } the weekend you have to spend a lot of time compensating { yeah } from drinking { yeah } mm hm { yeah and } it must get to be a lot to deal with
c: yeah I think it is and I think with getting this DUI (it’s) it’s just kind of too much and I’m starting to worry about myself
t: mm hm starting to worry about yourself
c: yeah so like I said I’m worrying about my health and um I just know that I can’t continue down this [nvv] down this road and I just try to think of like how much my dad drinks and how much I drink and I’m I’m trying to use him as kind of a a role model that you can still drink and go out and but it doesn’t have to be in excess
t: so he your father drinks in moderation { yeah } I’m hearing and um you’re kind of looking at him and saying that’s what I wanna do I’d like to be more moderate about it { yeah } uh huh
c: yeah I do I do want to be more moderate about it
t: whereas to now you’ve noticed (some) some extremity
c: yeah yeah and I I’m dating someone and my boyfriend says like I mean he’ll go out with me sometimes sometimes he won’t we have we have different schedules we’ve been dating for about six months and um sometimes I just like I can’t I don’t want to hang out with him cause I’m so hung over I just wanna stay at home
t: so it’s it’s um kind of affecting your relationship to him not even kind of you’re saying it’s { yeah } sometimes you don’t even feel like being with each other
c: yeah I I and [nvv] I think it’s it’s not affecting it as much as it could because we’re on such different schedules and he works on the weekends and I don’t work on the weekends so he’s busy so I can do what I want to do but I think if I I think I could be doing lots of other things I could be hanging out with my friends { mm hm } when we’re not drinking { mm hm } um if I wasn’t if I wasn’t hung over
t: so you [du] you’ve { kind of identif* | [nvv] or if I wasn’t } 
c: doing schoolwork
t: uh huh so there’s a bunch of activities that you feel you’re missing out on
c: sometimes yeah and my friends and I we do watch like we hang out on during the week and we watch movies and  sometimes we’ll just like casually drink but that doesn’t seem to be happening as much { hm } anymore 
t: which part isn’t happening as much any more
c: the casual drinking part of it
t: so are you saying that when you get together with your friends now it’s not casual drinking it’s more kind of serious extreme drinking or 
c: yeah or there’s more intent to go out and really party
t: uh huh and you said that happens during the week instead of just on the weekends
c: sometimes during the week but not not very often { uh huh } it’s happening more often during the week than it had in the past like maybe once a week instead of once a month
t: yeah it sounds like maybe you’re a little surprised about how things are now where they’ve gotten
c: yeah I don’t really know how I got to this point and I never thought that I would be someone who was gonna get a DUI I never thought I’d be that person
t: so it’s um in some ways it’s not really fitting with your { [nvv] } self image you look in the mirror and say I’m not sure I can match what’s { yeah } going on with who I think I am
c: yeah like I’m I’m a good student and I come from a good family and my parents are really supportive of what I’m doing um and I just I just don’t know how I got here 
t: mm hm mm hm I imagine that would be { [nvv] } kinda scary
c: yeah it is really scary I just don’t know yeah I don’t know how it got to this point
t: yeah I noticed your leg is shaking
c: [nvv] yeah I’m like really nervous to be here
t: yeah is it difficult to talk about
c: yeah cause it makes it more real when I talk about it
t: more it’s more real if you confront it
c: yeah yeah cause I can’t just like sit and think about it by myself or talk to like talking to a lawyer doesn’t it doesn’t feel real it still feels like I’m on a TV show or something { mm hm } but like sitting here it just makes it like really it’s { very real | really real } yeah
t: and when it’s real it seems maybe it’s more dangerous in a way 
c: [nvv] yeah
